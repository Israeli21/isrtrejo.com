            Hi, I'm Israel Trejo, a computer science student with strong skills in C++ and hands-on experience with Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
            I'm passionate about software development and have completed projects where I built webpages where I practiced problem solving code.
            I'm excited to apply these skills in a real-world setting and make a meaningful impact through an internship!
